# Python AI Chat Bot


What the project does:
          This is my first attempt at desiging an AI chat bot using python. This is completely object oriented as the program is written with a function to read users input: "userInput = T.get("1.0", 'end-1c')" and using a While true condition cycle through a list of objects of the function "getdata()" and respond based of if-else statements. So this is not really true AI. Using procedural programming in my own opinion is not how to write AI programs better to use declaritive and I intend to use prolog in future to do this. 

Why the project is useful:
        To give a better understanding of writting AI algorithms and machine learning. 

Who maintains and contributes to the project:  Developer
